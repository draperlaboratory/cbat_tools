# This tests that the absence wp-pointer-reg-list flag works as expected.
# Specifically, differing return value should be found between programs because
# in main_1, num_1 cannot be greater than 12. In main_2, num1 can point to local
# and become 42, which is greater than 12. This results in main_1 returning 
# 0 and main_2 returning -1.

# Should return SAT
