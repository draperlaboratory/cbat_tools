# With main.asm, this spec says that
# 0) [RSI] and [RSP] aren't "close" to each other
# 1) [RSI] is equal to 0x0000000000000003 (see "mov QWORD [rsi], 3" in main.asm)
# 2) [RSI] and [RDI] are equal
# And uses these to prove...
# 3) RAX is equal to 0x03
# This is because RAX is assinged to [RDI] in main.asm
# This spec is the same as full_reg_memcpy_asm/true.sh except that we use a forall
#   statement over the register indexes in RDI and RSI
