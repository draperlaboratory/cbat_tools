(**

   This module exports types and utilities to process and report results found
   using the WP plugin.

   The report contains information about the result of the WP analysis, and in
   the case the result is [SAT], prints out the model that contains the input
   register and memory values that result in the program refuting a goal, the path
   taken to the refuted goal, and the register values at each jump in the path.

(** Prints out the result from check, and if the result is [SAT], generate a model that
    represents the registers and memory values that lead to a specific program state,
    a list of goals that have been refuted, and if specified, the paths that lead to
    the refuted goals. *)
