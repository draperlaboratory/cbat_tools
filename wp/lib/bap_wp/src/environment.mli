   It contains a Z3 context, a {!var_gen}, the association between BIR variables
   and Z3 constants, preconditions for previously visited blocks, a mapping of Z3
   variables to function calls during runtime, subroutine summaries, a handler for
   loop unrolling, and expression verification conditions.
