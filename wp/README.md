# Weakest Precondition Analysis (WP)

The weakest precondition analysis consists of two parts.

* A weakest precondition [OCaml library](./lib), which can be installed and used on its own for general weakest precondition analysis. See the README for details about installation and usage.

* A weakest precondition [BAP plugin](./plugin), which is a program comparison tool based on the weakest precondition library. See the README for details about installation and usage, as well as information about how the tool works.
