<p>CBAT is a collection of tools for analyzing the behavior of binary programs.
Its primary purpose is to <i>compare</i> the behavior of programs.  For
example, CBAT can be used to verify that a patch has not introduced any new
bugs, or that an optimization has not changed the behavior of a function.  It
also has features for single-program analysis.

<P>CBAT is built on Carnegie
Mellon's <a href="https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap">Binary Analysis
Platform</a> (BAP).
