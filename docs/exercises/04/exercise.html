<h1>Exercise 04: Compare Function Calls</h1>

<p>For this exercise, make sure you run all commands from the directory:

<h2>The sample binary programs</h2>

<p>In the <code>binary</code> folder, there are two programs: <code>binary/main_1</code> and <code>binary/main_2</code>. Their source code resides at <a href="binary/main_1.c">binary/main_1.c</a> and <a href="binary/main_2.c">binary/main_2.c</a>. 

<p>These two programs are simplified versions of some code from Apple's SSL library, and they mimic a real bug that was discovered in Apple's SSL library a few years back (it was called the "goto fail" exploit). 

<p>The important function is called <code>SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange</code>. The first version of this function (in <code>binary/main_1</code>) has a bug. In the second version (in <code>binary/main_2</code>), the bug is fixed.

<p>This particular bug is revealed by analyzing the function calls that can occur inside <code>SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange</code>. It turns out that the bug makes it so that different function calls can occur in the buggy and fixed versions.

<h2>Your task</h2>

<p>Your task is to use <code>wp</code> to find the bug. To do that, complete the following tasks:

<ol>
  <li>Use <code>wp</code> to check the function calls in the <code>SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange</code> function. Be sure to include <code>--wp-show=refuted-goals</code> when you run <code>wp</code>. How do the two programs differ, with respect to the function calls they can make?</li>
  <li>Study the output of <code>wp</code>, and then study the source code of the two programs, to identify where the bug lies in the source code.</li>
</ol>
