(** Computes the domain size, i.e., the number of elements that can be
    represented with a CLP of words that are all [i]-bits wide.

    The result is thus 2^i. For instance, with 3-bits, you can get represent
    2^3 elements, i.e., 8 elements (the numbers 0--7, for instance).

    The result is returned as a binary word, of a specified [width].
    So, [dom_size i ~width:w] returns 2^i, represented as a [w]-bit word.
    For example, [dom_size 3 ~width:4] returns [b1000]. If you omit [~width],
    the default is [i + 1].

    Note that if you specify a width [w] and an [i] such that [i = w], then
    [dom_size] will return zero. For example, [dom_size 3 ~width:3] will
    return [b000]. With 3 bits, you can represent 8 elements [b1000], but
    you need 4 bits (rather than [~width:3]) to represent 8.

    So one should always invoke this [dom_size] function with [w > i],
    in order to guarantee that the result can be represented by the
    returned word. *)
