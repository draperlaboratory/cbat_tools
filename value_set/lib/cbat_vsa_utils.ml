(* When set to true, the analysis is UNSOUND in general. Note that the
   analysis will print a note if it might be unsound (i.e. no note
   implies soundness, but not vice versa).
   When true, the analysis will assume that loads and stores are done on
   memory bounds, i.e. bytes are only assigned to as a part of a fixed,
   contiguous, word-sized group.

let unsound_assume_memory_alignment = ref true

(* When set to true, the analysis is UNSOUND. Specifically, any values derived
   from RSP will be incorrect. However, so long as these values never overlap
   other pointers, the values they point to should be correct.
   TODO: implement the "value-set" part of the analysis to make this more robust
